# Consumer Nurtient Recycling Stoichiometry
An attempt at developing the box model from Sterner (1990) in R 

Stener 1990 developed a pool and flux model to evaluate consumer-nutrient recycling in a pelagic setting using a simple (but ellegant) model between dissolved, phytoplankton and zooplankton pools of nutrients.

From Stener (1990), Pools and fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus in the lower-pelagic food web. The three fluxes indicated by soild arrows between pools are considered by Sterner 1990.
